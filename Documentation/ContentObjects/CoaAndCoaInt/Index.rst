COBJ\_ARRAY (COA, COA\_INT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a cObject, in which you can place several other cObjects using
numbers to enumerate them.

It has the alias COA standing for "content object array". You can also
call it "COA" instead of COBJ\_ARRAY.

You can also create this object as a COA\_INT in which case it works
exactly like the :ref:`USER_INT <cobj-user-int>` object does: It's rendered non-cached! That
way COA\_INT allows you not only to render :ref:`USER_INT <cobj-user-int>` objects
non-cached, but to render *every* cObject non-cached.


.. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         1,2,3,4...

   Data type
         :ref:`cObject <data-type-cobject>`


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         if

   Data type
         :ref:`->if <if>`

   Description
         If "if" returns false, the COA is **not** rendered.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         wrap

   Data type
         :ref:`wrap <data-type-wrap>` /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         stdWrap

   Data type
         :ref:`->stdWrap <stdwrap>`


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         includeLibs

   Data type
         *(list of resources)* /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         **(This property is used only if the object is COA\_INT! See
         introduction.)**

         This is a comma-separated list of resources that are included as PHP-
         scripts (with include\_once() function) if this script is included.

         This is possible to do, because any include-files will be known before
         the scripts are included. That is not the case with the regular
         PHP\_SCRIPT cObject.
